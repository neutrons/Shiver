To build documentation:

1. Install Jekyll using ruby and bundler - https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/
2. In a terminal, go to the docs folder
3. Run `bundle install`
4. To run site locally, run `bundle exec jekyll serve`. The site is at http://127.0.0.1:4000/Shiver/

When developing on the same machine, one needs to run steps 1-3 only once. If the server is running, if you make changes to the md file, just refresh the pages. If you change the configuration file you need to restart the server
