Future plans
============

* Create/employ additional correction functions that work on the MDEvent workspaces: 
    - absorption correction
    - Debye-Waller correction
    - magnetic form factor
    - polarization angle correction
* Refactor the scripting to use the Shiver algorithms
* Efficiency improvements (speed/ memory/ disk usage)

<!--
* Generate background from regions of the data, as described in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.9.011035)
