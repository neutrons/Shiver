Welcome to SHIVER's documentation!
==================================
The Spectroscopy HIstogram Visulizer for Event Reduction **(SHIVER)** is a tool to
allow examination of time of flight inelastic neutron data, from single crystal,
direct geometry experiments. It is intended to perform the following tasks:

* Transform time of flight data from multiple orientations into a single intermediate
  structure in units of reciprocal space and energy transfer


* Allow slicing of the intermediate file and creation of histograms containing S(**Q**, âˆ† *E*)
  with various dimensionality


* Visualize the histograms
